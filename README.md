# Udacity's Landing Page Project

## Description
The purpose of this project is to learn the fundamentals of interacting and manipulating the DOM using JavaScript, by building an interactive Landing Page from some boilerplate HTML and CSS.

The citeria is:
1. Dynamically create a navbar based on the amount of sections. 
2. Link active state CSS to the section most prominent in the viewport. 
3. The active state must light up the relevant section in the navbar as well.
4. Clicking on a section must scroll it into view.

## Usage and dependencies 
This project is used for learning how to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript. The code can be run in any browser and no dependencies are needed. Explore the JavaScript file and make changes to explore the effects in the browser.
