# Udacity's Landing Page Project


## Description
The purpose of this project is to learn the fundamentals of interacting and manipulating the DOM using JavaScript, by building an interactive Landing Page from some boilerplate HTML and CSS.

The citeria is:
1. Dynamically create a navbar based on the amount of sections. 
2. Link active state CSS to the section most prominent in the viewport. 
3. The active state must light up the relevant section in the navbar as well.
4. Clicking on a section must scroll it into view.
